# Un-Wasted iOS
üçî A blockchain implementation of a social food app | Un-Wasted! | Your Bite on the Block

An app built at [StartHACK 2018](http://live.starthack.ch), designed to reduce food waste by crowdsourcing good to eat food that would otherwise go wasted. To ensure trust and transparency we stored available food items on a decentralized ledger and rewarded users for donating food with our own crypto token. Food exchanged were verified using smart contracts written in Etherium.

The project was formed of four main components:
1. An iOS application, contained within this repository.
2. A NodeJS backend written by [Alicia](https://github.com/lissy93) that can be found [here](https://github.com/lissy93/un-wasted)
3. Blockchain Solidity smart contracts, written by [Theo](https://github.com/theomessin) than can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/theomessin/9a8228815ad7dceb95a7ae77468d3f4a)
4. A pitch deck, containing the business proposal and launch strategies created by Anna Heid.
